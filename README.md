DISCLAIMER: Took all inspiration from wordle and this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wak7iN4JZzU&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified), they get all the credit

Version 1.0 <br />
The program works and is ready to be played <br />
<br /> <br />
To be included in future updates: <br /> <br />
Priority: Add emoji results to share to friends, Add tiles dancing when there is a winner <br />
Eventually have the words come from an api rather than that big list in the java script file  <br />
Non Priority: HOW TO PLAY SCREEN, Settings with dark mode/light mode and an email me, make it possible to share the results with emojis, get new back button(dont use the one wordle uses), Make this documentation sound professional, add comments for all functions <br /> <br /> <br />
